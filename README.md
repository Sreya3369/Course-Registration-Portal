# Course-Registration-Portal
This project presents an online course registration system designed to streamline the course selection process for users while providing administrators with robust management capabilities. The system allows administrators to log in and view all courses selected by users. Additionally, it offers the functionality to send automated emails to users based on their IDs through Gmail. Users are granted a one-time opportunity to log in and select a course of their choice, ensuring a streamlined and fair registration process. The project is implemented using PHP for server-side logic, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript handling the front-end interface. The system is hosted using XAMPP, making it easily deployable on local servers.
